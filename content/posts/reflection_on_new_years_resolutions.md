# A reflection on new years resolutions

This is has been one of the most exciting years of my life. For the first time in my adult life I didn't set up unrealistic new years resolutions. It was kind of easy for me to look at the things my, now, wife and I had pretty much plan for the year ahead. Everything on a personal and profession was evaluate based on how close it got us closer to achieve the plan.

Running 1000km this year is definetely a better plan than getting in shape. Evey week I was able to evaluate whether I had done enough to get there and then readjust. And I got 980km but that's definetely better than I have done in the past. 

Another example of this, related to professional goals, I wanted to improve my position at work, and I also wanted to re-look at the sort of work I was taking in as side project. I didn't have a grand plan, expect adding tests for pretty much everything I was writing. I picked up phunit and jest, and this helped me a lot as was working on my trial project at automattic. And I started pick up projects outside my confort zone. That allowed me to develop skills with infrastructure, cloud and devops. And I was able to pass my AWS developer certification. I have tried picking up cloud before, and I had been stuck in tutorial purgatory for a while. Actively challenging myself to complete real projects was a lot more valuable than paying for another coursera course.

## What's to come?

Not sure, I am starting a new job in a month and I am super excited about that. I'd like to do well and I want to contribute more. I am maintening a few project within the Drupal community. As I am joining WP I would like to publish my woocommerce stellr plugin on wp.org.

And the goal this year is again 1000 km on the road. and I am building strength up to 100 push up a day, starting with 20 push ups a day. I will make the tracker plublic on my notion.

Again make sure your goals are clear and realistic and actionable. 

let's go get it.
