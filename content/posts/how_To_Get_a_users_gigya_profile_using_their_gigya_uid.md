This is technical document to serve an implementation reference by Developer. We assume that you have the gigya PHP SDK and gigya raas drupal 8 module installed in your project.

We've had multiple issues with getting user's profiles or showing users information on the site – This is because of the limitation of the[ Gigya Client Side - Web SDK ](https://developers.gigya.com/display/GD/Web+SDK). The user information have to be queried server side and this is how:

## Step-by-step guide

- You need to instantiate the helper class:

  ```php
    $helper = new Drupal\gigya\Helper\GigyaHelper();
    $api =  $helper->getGigyaApiHelper();
  ```

-  You can then fetch the user Gigya Account by calling fetchGigyaAccount($uid) this takes the gigya user id as a parameter

  

  ```php
  // The gigya UID is the drupal user uuid.
  // Assuming the you have the user account interface loaded this can be fetched like this.
  
  $uid = $account→uuid();
  $gigya_user = $helper->getGigyaApiHelper()->fetchGigyaAccount($uid);
  ```

  

- FetchGigyaAccount throws an exception:

  ```php
  Drupal\gigya\CmsStarterKit\sdk\GSApiException
  ```

  
  Remember to catch this in your code to avoid critical errors.
